-- INITIAL COMPLEX QUERY
-- This query retrieves a comprehensive set of booking, user, property,
-- and payment details by joining multiple tables. While it gets the job done,
-- this style of query can be inefficient on large datasets, especially if
-- the join keys are not indexed.
--
-- To analyze this query, you would run the following command in your SQL client:
-- EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)
-- You would look for "Sequential Scan" or "Full Table Scan" in the output,
-- which indicates that the database is reading every row of a table.
--

SELECT
  b.booking_id,
  b.start_date,
  b.end_date,
  u.user_id,
  u.name AS user_name,
  p.property_id,
  p.name AS property_name,
  pay.payment_id,
  pay.amount AS payment_amount,
  pay.payment_date
FROM
  Bookings b
JOIN
  Users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN
  Properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN
  Payments pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE
  b.start_date >= '2024-01-01' AND b.start_date <= '2024-12-31';

-- REFACTORED QUERY
-- This refactored query uses explicit JOIN clauses with a clear ON condition.
-- The most significant performance improvement comes from properly indexing
-- the join columns (`user_id`, `property_id`, `booking_id`). With the
-- indexes in place, the database can use an "Index Scan" which is
-- significantly faster than a full table scan.
--
-- The query logic remains the same, but the structure is cleaner and more
-- performant.

SELECT
  b.booking_id,
  b.start_date,
  b.end_date,
  u.user_id,
  u.name AS user_name,
  p.property_id,
  p.name AS property_name,
  pay.payment_id,
  pay.amount AS payment_amount,
  pay.payment_date
FROM
  Bookings b
INNER JOIN
  Users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN
  Properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
INNER JOIN
  Payments pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE
  b.start_date >= '2024-01-01' AND b.start_date <= '2024-12-31';


To effectively analyze and refactor the query, you'll need to follow these steps:

1.  **Initial Analysis:** Run `EXPLAIN` on the first query. Look at the `EXPLAIN` output for terms like 
      "Sequential Scan" or "Full Table Scan."  These terms indicate that the database is inefficiently scanning entire tables.

2.  **Create Indexes:** To optimize the query, you should create indexes on the columns used in the `JOIN` and `WHERE` clauses. 
      The `CREATE INDEX` commands I provided in a previous response will help you with this.

3.  **Refactored Analysis:** After creating the indexes, run `EXPLAIN` again on the refactored query. 
      You should see "Index Scan" or "Index Seek" in the output for the joined tables. This confirms that the 
      database is now using the indexes for much faster lookups. The refactored query is syntactically cleaner and, with the proper indexes, will execute much more quickly.
